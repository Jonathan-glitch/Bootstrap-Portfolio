      <p class="col-md-6"> Hello My name is Jonathan Ruiz,<br> This is a quick run-down fo my Work History at first from 2013-2015 I worked for a company that was hired to run concession stand in sport arenas. Then From 2015-2016 I woked at Levis Jeans.co as a sales. Now I am working for Er Jahna, I started in 2016 and thats where i have been a scale house operator so far and this is where i had the joy of working with a program that worked great but it was way outdated and i said to my self i feel like i can definitely do better so i started seeking info on how to create programs and I saw that my local college provided a coding bootcamp and looked up what a coder did and as far as read the more i saw of my self it felt only right to do and seek a carer that felt that it was going o definitey be right for me.
